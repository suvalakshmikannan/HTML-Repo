<center><h1>AIRCRAFT</h1>
<p>Aircraft are machines that have been designed for the purpose of flying through the air.
<br>An aircraft may also be referred to as an airplane, an airliner, or just a plane.It can be<br>powered or unpowered and come in various 
shapes,such as ballons,gliders,helicopters, and airplanes.<br>There are many uses for aircraft,including commercial transportation,military 
operations,scientific research,and entertainment.<br>People can now travel faster and farther than ever thanks to the invention of aircraft, 
which has completely changed modern transportation.</p>

<h2>FIXED-WING AIRCRAFT</h2>
<p>Fixed-wing aircraft are those that have their wings attached to the fuselage so that they<br>
 can create lift while flying through the air. This lift is produced by the air flowing over<br>
 the curved surface of the wing, which results in an area of low pressure above the wing and<br>
 an area of high pressure below the wing.From small,single-engine aircraft to huge commercial<br> 
 airliners, fixed-wing aircraft cover a wide range of aircraft.The forward thrust required to<br> 
 move the aircraft through the air is typically provided by one or more jet engines or<br>
 propeller engines.</p>
<hr>
<h2>ROTARY WING AIRCRAFT</H2>
<P>A rotary-wing aircraft uses rotating blades or rotors to generate lift, allowing it to hover<br> 
in place and take off vertically and land vertically. Helicopters are the most common and popular<br> 
rotary-wing aircraft, but autogyros and tiltrotors are also available.A rotary-wing aircraft has<br>
a rotor that can be controlled to move in any direction. This rotor is powered by an engine.In general,<br>
rotary-wing aircraft are adaptable and suitable for various uses, such as transport,search and rescue,<br>
and military operations.They can fly in places where fixed-wing aircraft cannot, including cities,<br>
mountainous terrain, and the ocean.</P>

<H2>BALLOONS</H2>
<P>A balloon aircraft is a type of aircraft that obtains lift from a sizable, lightweight, frequently
 spherical, or elongated balloon that is filled with helium or hot air. By controlling the gas density 
within the balloon, balloon aircraft rise and fall passively, unlike airplanes and helicopters, which 
require propulsion systems to move through the air.Hot air balloons, gas balloons, and hybrid balloons, 
which use hot air and gas to produce lift, are some of the more popular balloon aircraft. In addition 
to being used for fun activities like sightseeing and thrill rides, balloon aircraft are also frequently 
used for scientific research, weather observation, and other uses that call for a stable and controlled
platform in the air.</P>
